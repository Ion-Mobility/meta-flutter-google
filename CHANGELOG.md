Aug 4, 2023
* Parity with Kirkstone branch

March 17, 2023
* APP_GEN_SNAPSHOT_FLAGS - allows setting gen_snapshot flags like `--no-use-integer-division`
* FLUTTER_APP_RUNTIME_MODES - allows setting runtime mode per app.  Deprecates use of FLUTTER_APP_SKIP_DEBUG_INSTALL.
* APP_AOT_EXTRA_DART_DEFINES - allows setting Dart defines for AOT builds
* Local version patch override. allows overriding patch set applied.  Could also be in bbappend.

March 5, 2023
* 3.7.6 support introduced
* Toyota OSS 0223
* local resolution of Flutter SDK and Engine Versions - LTS

Dec 26, 2022

* dart-sdk added - building/linking with the Yocto Clang toolchain.
* Package Groups added - flutter-agl-apps, flutter-test-apps
* Container Image added - app-container-image, app-container-image-flutter-auto
* Breaking Changes

  Removed BBCLASS implementation for -runtimedebug, -runtimeprofile, -runtimerelease
  Removed FLUTTER_RUNTIME
  Flutter Engine runtime variants are now built based on PACKAGECONFIG values: debug, profile, release, jit_release.  The default is release.
  To add additional runtime variants in addition to `release` use this pattern in local.conf:
      `PACKAGECONFIG:append:pn-flutter-engine = " profile debug"`
  flutter-app.bbclass installs app for each engine build available in the target sysroot.
  By default Flutter Apps are not installed for runtime=debug.  This can be overriden in local.conf using `FLUTTER_APP_SKIP_DEBUG_INSTALL = "false"`.

* Breaking Change
  
  Suffix for flutter runtime types has been changed to better define it.  Less confusing. 

  -runtimerelease (was -release)
  -runtimeprofile (was -profile)
  -runtimedebug (was -debug)

* FLUTTER_CHANNEL support has been deprecated

* FLUTTER_SDK_TAG - New approach.  Allows locking SDK and Engine to specific commit hash.
  Valid values for FLUTTER_SDK_TAG are here:  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tags
  
* Flutter Engine Commit
  The Flutter Engine Commit is based on the value of `FLUTTER_SDK_TAG.`
  The default value of `FLUTTER_SDK_TAG` is set in `conf/include/flutter-version.inc`.  If `FLUTTER_SDK_TAG` is overriden with `"AUTOINC"` in local.conf, stable channel is used for the engine commit.

* build failure due to gn unknown parameter for `--no-build-embedder-examples`.  One solution to resolve this is to exclude `disable-embedder-examples` from PACKAGECONFIG in local.conf using:

  ```
  PACKAGECONFIG_pn-flutter-engine = "disable-desktop-embeddings embedder-for-target fontconfig debug profile release"
   ```
  This issue is related to missing gn options `--build-embedder-examples` and `--no-build-embedder-examples` from certain builds.  I have `disable-embedder-examples` defined in PACKAGECONFIG by default, so if you have an engine commit that is missing this option, you need to use the PACKAGECONFIG sequence above.  Once the gn option rolls into all channels this override will no longer be needed.
